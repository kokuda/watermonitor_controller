# Watermonitor Controller

> Well water pumphouse microcontroller monitoring projects for monitoring the depth of a water tank and reporting to the [watermonitor_server](https://github.com/kokuda/watermonitor-server). 

> **esp8266_monitor** is a microcontroller project that runs on an esp8266 nodemcu 1.0 for measuring the water depth of a watertank and posting it to a REST API server.

> **esp8266_config** is a microcontroller project that stores configuration information in an esp2866 flash file to configure the monitor app.

A PCB containing the components for this project has been designed with EasyEDA [here](https://easyeda.com/account/project/detail?project=d201379c56a940c88d4f349ca20fe02c).  Note that the pin usage is slightly different than the code to make the PCB design a bit simpler, but the code has not yet been updated or tested with this layout.
